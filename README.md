# i3-themes
A place to keep all my i3wm color configs 

## Structure:

my i3config file needs to be grabbed at github/FantasticDoodle/i3Config. At the bottom you need to edit the different color codes in accordance to this.

You can easily substitue your config file for mine and just paste in the configs because these will work with any i3config.

Quick tip, if you want to make a custom theme use the eyedropper feature in firefox. it works great to pick out the colors.
